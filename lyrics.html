				<p>
					You're saying it's hopeless, that I should hope less<br>
					Heaven can help us, well maybe "she" might<br>
					You say it's beyond us, what is beyond us?<br>
					Let's see and decide<br>
					We've been meteoric, even before this<br>
					Burns half as long when it's twice as bright<br>
					So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us<br>
					Let's see and decide<br>
					And I will still be here, stargazing<br>
					I'll still look up, look up<br>
					Look up for love<br>
					I will still be here, stargazing<br>
					I'll still look up, look up<br>
					Look up for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					I'm trying to save us, you don't wanna save us<br>
					You blame human nature, and say it's unkind<br>
					Let's make up our own minds, we've got our whole lives<br>
					Let's see and decide, decide<br>
					And I will still be here, stargazing<br>
					I'll still look up, look up<br>
					Look up for love<br>
					Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing<br>
					Even when the night is over<br>
					And I will still be here, stargazing<br>
					I'll still look up, look up<br>
					Look up for love<br>
					Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing<br>
					Even when the night is over<br>
					That's how I find the light<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					That's how I find the light<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me (oh)<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					That's how I find the light<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love<br>
					That's how I find the light<br>
					Don't you, give up, for me (oh)<br>
					Don't fall, don't give up, for love
